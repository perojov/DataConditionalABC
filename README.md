# DataConditionalABC

## Overview

DataConditionalABC is a Python package for conducting Bayesian inference in Stochastic Differential Equations through Approximate Bayesian Computation - Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC-SMC). The package features both forward simulation using Euler-Maruyama, and data-conditional simulation as introduced in our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10329). It utilizes partially exchangeable networks for the estimation of summary statistics.
